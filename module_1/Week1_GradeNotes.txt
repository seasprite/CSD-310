Module 1.1: Excellent discussion on relating what databases you regularly interact with! With this many students, it's pretty easy to find a few to comment on. Don't forget, you can post more than the required number.

Module 1.2: Good! Most of you got this exactly right. You were to create your own repository and clone that to your local machine. No other requirements at this time, but you will be using your repository to collect future assignments in multiple courses. As I have bookmarked your repository URLs, I can grade the contents when needed.

Module 1.3: Looks like everyone got this done. While we will be focusing on MySQL, you do need to know about NoSQL databases also as they are being used more and more.
 
Couple of comments... first.. put your name in every file you upload. When I download, if there is no name, I don't know whose work it is. Whether ,docx, .pptx, .xls, code, UML, etc..., all need your name to appear in the document. If this continues to be an issue, I'll give zero points for anonymous submissions.

You got the grades early, as I am having knee surgery on Wednesday, and will be unavailable the rest of the week. If you have questions or issues, contact Darrell Payne, or Phil Fitzpatrick (pfitzpat@bellevue.edu), or ask for help from other students in Bb or Discord.

Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
Prof. Sue
